SKCC75 is designed to take parts from the IBM Pingmaster keyboard without the need to hunt for extra parts for any compatibility. 

The V1 is true to the design of the Pingmaster with its rounded out front and back bezels. The later revisions are simplified to make manufacturing easier and cheaper.
