AEK75 is a project where I attempt to design a 75% keyboard to accept AEK M0115 parts. However, since there is a 1.75u right shift key, you may need to source a keycap for that or source a 1.75u command key from an M0116. All other parts including the stabilizers are designed to take parts from M0115. 

The indicator LEDs are designed to use standard 3.0mm LEDs commonly used for modern MX style switches. 

Keep in mind that the case design IS NOT FINALIZED. Upon prototyping, there have been some issues and it needs some minor tweaking to get it right. 

The PCB design has been finalized.
