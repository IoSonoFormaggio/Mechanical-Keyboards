The MCK84 is a project where I design a case for the Ortek MCK-84 keyboard which is a vintage 75% keyboard that takes alps switches. The case doesn't have a plate for it or a PCB designed for it since the original innards (which is a sandwich mount board) should fit right into the case without any desoldering or reassembly required. 

The USB cutout is designed so that it would fit perfectly when using a Teensy 2.0 and doublde sided taping it right next to the cable (white 4-pin connector on the PCB). 

The board works well with soarer's converter.
